    We previously disabled updating handle to prevent conflict in our database, but the issue has been fixed, you can now update your handle at any point in time, but bear in mind that for visibility, it's encouranged that you avoid frequent change of your display name as it is tied your profile link. Though, you can update your display name in the profile page as much as you like; We are careful not to mess things, so we've imposed some restrictions, such as 3 - 13 characters limit on handle, a-z,A - Z, 0-9, and an underscore are the only acceptable characters for handle. You can't use any of the following as you handle ["favourite", "news", "notification", "crunch", "info", "handle", "viewcrunch"] to prevent unexpected behaviour`,
