        improving the Site. By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use information in accordance with this policy.
        INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable
        information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally, identifiable information may include, but is not limited to
        your name which we don’t ask for but your handle (username) as a way of reference to a particular manager. PERSONAL INFORMATION
        Some common personally identifiable information we collect and what we do with the data we receive: • Handle/Nickname: A way for
        other managers and ViewCrunch to identify you instead of collection real names; we prefer to use a nick name to protect privacy
        of every manager and avoid situation where a social media look up is carried out on a particular profile. • Birthday: To send
        special Present/Offer on your birth day and also in case of password reset where we are unable to identify a user requesting a
        password reset • Email &amp; Password: It is proprietary that every account has a way to authenticate with our server, there’s no
        better way to accomplish this without the traditional email/password unique way to identify/authorize and authenticate managers.
        • Gender: Your gender will never be revealed to any user, we use gender data collection for advanced cases of password reset and
        like birthday data collection, we also carry out statistics with Gender. LOG DATA Like many site operators, we collect
