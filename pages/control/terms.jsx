        Improvement for its entirety, though we accept donations, we also incorporated Ads as a way to the gain/get funds to keep our
        service running 24/7 at full speed and accessible to everyone from every race, religion etc. PedroView will never ask you to pay
        any amount to use any portion of our service at any time or for anything. If you wish to purchase any product or service made
        available through the Ads on this website, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase, PedroView
        bears no attachment and no responsibility of what you choose to do on any ad network and would not be held liable for your
