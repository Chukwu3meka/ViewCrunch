        <u>PERSONAL INFORMATION</u>
        Some common personally identifiable information we collect and what we do with the data we receive: • Handle/Nickname: A way for
        other viewers and ViewCrunch to identify you instead of collection real names; we prefer to use a nick name to protect privacy of
        every viewer and avoid situation where a social media look up is carried out on a particular profile. • For sake of Privacy we do
        not ask for Birthdate or Gender. • Email &amp; Password: It is proprietary that every account has a way to authenticate with our
        server, there’s no better way to accomplish this without the traditional email/password unique way to identify/authorize and
        authenticate viewers. but for a more secure and reliable method to ensure account safety, we've utilized a modern way of
        passwordless authentication using only your Facebook account • Gender: We'll never ask for your gender neither will it be
        revealed to any user since we don't have it. We also carry out statistics with ViewCrunch. LOG DATA Like many site operators, we
