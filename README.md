## About ViewCrunch

ViewCrunch is an online blog, where user being authors or viewers can publish their views or any subject, like/dislike views, follow crunches or users(author/viewers), update/delete published views, authenticate using Twitter, Facebook and Google. There's a lot to learn from this project and i advice you follow through in order to learn and build something even greater, instead of copying a code you cannot explain, just to impress recruiters

This is a project is one of my favourite and i decided to make it open source so people or rather developers who are just getting started with Next.js and Firebase can learn quickly from a real project, without the need of having to pay or purchase any item. As my mentor Marcus, introduced me to writting, I'm working on publishing a tutorial soon where i explain everything you see in this project.

The project performs more than a basic CRUD. It also uses a REST api from RapidAPI to fetch its NEWS content, and the magic is that free API's on RapidAPI is limited to 10 API calls, but what we did is fetch ones easch day, whenever any visitor opens the NEWS page and save to the database, then when another user opens the NEWS page, we check if we have NEWS stored for today.

This project goes over all of the fundamentals of Next.js and Firebase including...

- Components
- JSX
- Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc)
- State (Component & App Level)
- Styling
- Handling Events
- Lists & Keys
- Forms
- Context API
- HTTP Requests
