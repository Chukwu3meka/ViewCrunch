As we wonder through life most time aimlessly,though the wrong direction we end up stuck at one sport or the other.We call this getting
stuck addiction and i had to live with mine for 8 years. Addiction can come in many forms be it
fear,Alcohol,Masturbation,drugs,game,soccer etc 1.Fear; when i was younger,i was a complete definition of introvert multiplied by
melancholy. i didn't see it as a problem as i enjoyed being alone even till this point.I found out one day when i went to read in church
that i had a trembling legs like someone suffering from cold while being electorcuted,that was containable,but the notable fact was that
when i took the mic to read i discovered my voice had left and then i was speaking like an 89 years old lady laden with stroke every
other illness was cracking as if there was a severve Network problem. 1. I had to start metting people and trying to speak while
maintaining eye contact 2.
