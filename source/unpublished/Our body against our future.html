I once read a book and it said our body has a default setting to work against our future and seek temporal pleasures,this default setting
has to do with our body in all possible means trying to avoid pain,discomfort. <br />
We naturally get inclened to thing that give us temporal,joy such as 6 hours of watching,arguing and discussing movies,sport and
music.while failing to understand those private business owned by someone not even concerned about your future.on average a year. <br />
1.News broadcasters earn<br />
2.Music industry earns<br />
3.soccer clubs earns<br />
4.movie producers earn<br />
5.Game programmers earn <br />
<br />If you don't earn that much a year is it worth giving the long productive hours of your life to them instead of working on
something that will impact lives in the long run such as learning a new handwork,programming and more.
