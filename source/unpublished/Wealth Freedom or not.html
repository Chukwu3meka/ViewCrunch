Wealth: Freedom or not wealth,freedom

<p>
  Wealth or riches as we all know refers to valuable material possession or abundance. Now the question is does wealth really give us a
  sense of freedom or not, even we can be in miserable comfort with wealth, We'll look at it from both perspective.

<ul>
  <li>Education: Access to best schools and materials but does not necessarily give you have the best brain or result</li>
  <li>
    Health: Access to best doctors and health care. Ability to fund any health treatment, but that doesn't give you the best health
  </li>
  <li>Leverage: Money makes more money, and having enough money to fund any program or start up doesn't guarantee success</li>
  <li>
    Diet: Enough money for special diet doesn't mean, Wealthy people don't live on carbohydrate alone but suffer more severe illness.
  </li>
  <li>Movement: Private jets/boat doesn't guarantee you'll arrive at your destination safely</li>
</ul>

  One thing I can't come up with is touching lives with your wealth, while you're alive, you have all the credit, joy and respect, You
  are also able to channel your fund exactly where you want it such as education, innovation, health and more. In no way is your wealth
  or what you use it for a bad thing, but I see a charitable use as a great investment and satisfaction
