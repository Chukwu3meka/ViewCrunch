Introduction to Client Side Rendering(CSR) and Server Side Rendering in React with focus on Nextjs

<p>
  I was a participant in a WhatsApp frontend group, and when these developers start a discussion on rendering issues client or server,
  I'm usually part of the group of people that either go offline or just mutely read their conversation. I wasn't bothered much about
  rendering my code does exactly what I want it to do, but when I started learning Next.js this rendering came up again.

<b>Client Side Rendering</b>
<p>
  Frameworks and libraries like react, backbone and Angular render everything on the client side, what this means is that when a user
  visits your react web page, for instance, your server will return an empty HTML file and then your browser will fetch *all* the
  JavaScript code, then compile them before rendering the content, you won't notice this much if you're on a fast network or in
  development. Fetching data or making API calls in the client side is not a bad idea and does not necessarily mean the whole page is
  client side rendered, as you can choose to paginate content and fetch more data as user scrolls down.
</p>
<b>Server Side Rendering (SSR) </b>
<p>
  Remember, the good old days with PHP for example when you visit a web page, data is fetched on the server, compiled and HTML is
  completely generated before sending to the client. Unlike Client Side Rendering where the HTML page is populated in the browser, in SSR
  the server returns a fully generated HTML page and send it to the client. In CSR, the browser starts displaying HTML instead of waiting
  for *all* JavaScript code to load; but this old PHP way of doing this made things bit slow by compiling HTML, CSS and JavaScript before
  displaying a page. In Next.js for instance www.nextjs.org/docs/basci-features/pages have something called pre rendering.

<p>
  By default Next.js pre-renders every page, by generating HTML for each page in advance and a minimal JavaScript code necessary for the
  page. When this page is loaded the JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive (This process is called Hydration) unlike
  CSR where all the browser has to compile everything before the page is interactive.
