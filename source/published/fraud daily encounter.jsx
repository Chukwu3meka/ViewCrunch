        Learning an IT skill is like arming yourself, the more complex your skill set, the more sophisticated you are. So its left with
        the world to provide a legitimate target to take on or they risk having you take on wrong person and then end creating havoc

        People are learning more about social engineering with their mind locked that no good person exists out there, by making simple
        things extremely complicated for the good guys and in turn this good guys begin to look for simple ways as no one loves the hard
        way, then we end up pushing good people to a very tight corner where they get to do the wrong things when faced with challenges.

      <b>Here are some reasons why scam flourish in Nigeria</b>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I once told a friend the primary reason why Internet fraud flourish in Nigeria is because the government is too busy enriching
          their pocket and neglecting scammers
        </li>
        <li>Parents and peers push people to scam others by exalting scammers that have made money</li>
        <li>Most scammers are knowledgeable in social engineering and lack other hacking skills</li>
        <li>
          Another sect to blame here is the so called 'Police', These guys benefit more(as compared to their salary) from their
          theft/share as they always get commission from scammers, else they go about harassing them
        </li>
        <li>Criminals are granted bail after crediting the government</li>
      </ol>
    </>
