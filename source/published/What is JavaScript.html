What is JavaScript
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a lightweight interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript was first released 4th, December 1995 by Brendan Eich, during his time at Netscape Communications, which at that time was the best browser in the world.
JavaScript, arguably on the best and most popular language of our time, is arguably the easiest and most utilized language to learn with unlimited number of functions. Originally it was called Mocha, then Livescript and finally JavaScript. JavaScript is completely different from Java.

At first JavaScript was created to add interactivity to your website such as games, buttons, forms, and many more. The dynamic content that JavaScript provided cannot be over emphasized, but today JavaScript has become the de-facto language of the web. JavaScript became an ECMA standard in 1997. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

From being a dynamic language, JS has gone round the sphere of ICT, below are some common applications of JS:

<ol>
<li>Web: Next.js, react, Vue.js, Angular, JQuery and backbone js</li>
<li>Desktop: Electro JS, Meteor and Appjs</li>
<li>Mobile: React Native, Flutter, Native Script, Ionic and Apache Cordova</li>
<li>Machine learning: Brain.js, ML.js and Keras.js</li>
<li>Server: Node JS and Express js</li>
<li>Database: Mongo DB</li>
</ol>

If you choose to learn JS today, bear in mind that your skill will not be obsolete anytime soon and JavaScript is here to stay; coupled with annual improvements
