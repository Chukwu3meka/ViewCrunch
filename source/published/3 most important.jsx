<!-- Three most important things in life -->

<p>
  When you hear someone talk about 'most important', it does'nt mean other criteria not in the list are not valueable or totally useless.
  For instance to able to study a particular course in the university, you need certain subjects with good grades up to a given score
  which is specified as 'minimum requirement'.
</p>
<p>
  When you're up for promotion, its based on your contributon to the team and how long you have served, but i tell you, if you don't take
  care of your health, you'll spend useful time in the hospital which you might end up fired even before promotion. Punctuality, social
  skill, vocabulary, commitment and so on; this little details don't really matter, but having a very bad rating in any of them, might be
  a roadblock to your promotion.
</p>
<h2>
  Now, back to business
</h2>
<p>
  The three most important things in life in no particular order are Rest, Moral and Career, and like i said you need other stuff to
  enjoy this three very well.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Career:
    <p>
      There is no job or school on earth without requirement be it 3 years in this or that. Your employer expects you to have learnt some
      things during those years. Learning being accumulated knowledge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Builds memory</li>
      <li>Improves learning speed</li>
      <li>Makes you more confident</li>
      <li>Keeps your brain healthy</li>
      <li>Prolongs lifespan</li>
      <li>Helps your finance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You get job(contract or fulltime) based on what you've learnt in the past. Nobody would hire a liability. Learning connects you
      with people, and this connections recommends you.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Moral
    <p>
      I don't know how atheist do it, but if you're someone like me who without prayer ends up doing something immoral, despite the
      decision not to do that. Mind you our body is weak. Muslim, Christian or any other religion lets people know the importance of
      prayer in soceity because it's a period where you disconnect from the world and connect with the divine, and that is why somewhere,
      somewhere said, 'Educating a child without religion is raising educated criminals'. I'm not saying Atheist are evil, as a matter of
      fact, you find Atheist who do good compared to Theist. Not as if those who pray don't fall but they are strenghtened spiritually to
      do more good.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Rest
    <p>
      Game, Excercise, Sleep etc is very important; Your muscles don't build when you excercise, its when you sleep, you're not sure
      about the line you just read, but there're so many benefits of sleep:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improves Memory</li>
      <li>Prevents Cancer</li>
      <li>Increses your reasoning</li>
      <li>Healtheir Heart</li>
      <li>Spur Creativity</li>
      <li>Makes you more attentive</li>
      <li>Better Productivity</li>
      <li>Prevents depression</li>
      <li>Stronger immune system</li>
      <li>Prvents mistake</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Aside sleep i don't expect you to work through out the day, take some time of gaming, chatting, movie and other fun things to gain
      more sleep
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
