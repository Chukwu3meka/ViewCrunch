Questions you should ask your self
<p>Everyday is a new year and each second, a new beginning.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did I write my new year resolution, in order not to forget it after breaking it a fewtimes, and if I did, What were the major obstacles in the way to your resolution. You need to know your obstacle before setting a new goal.</li>
<li>What was my biggest achievement/improvement of the year and how did you feel about it, let this feeling overshadow your mind whenever am low in spirit.</li>
<li>How much were you able to save, yes saving won’t increase your wealth much but it will reduce your spending and keep you ready to invest on profitable assets or such; This will also enable you see where your money is being spent.</li>
<li>Whose behaviour/character were you most happy with and did you apply those positive trait to your self, while at the same time, were you able to eliminate any weakness?</li>
<li>How many book did you read, knowledge is power, we all know and which skill did you acquire? On a scale of 10, are those skills economically useful if you find yourself in a different location?</li>
<li>How many lives did you touch, it doesn’t have to be financially as I don’t think question 5 was all about money, touching lives can be in the form of - how you lived; -advice you gave; -Empathy you showed; -Humility and many more</li>
<li>Did I follow my daily routine, my off day? Did I improve significantly as a result of my routine? If no, Create a different routine or workout your challenges</li>
<li>Where do you see yourself in 5 years time? How realistic is your answer? It doesn’t have to be too easy or unrealistic and how close to it are you now compared to 364 days ago?</li>
<li>What do others think of me: Unlike most people say I don’t care about what others think of me. I’m in no way saying you live your live according to what others want, but at times they are the mirror that point out our weakness and tell us who we really are; that’s the bitter truth</li>
<li>What was your greatest lesson, do you need to keep that in your skill for a while as you work on your fears, don’t let your fear control you.</li>
<li>Was this a positive/negative year for you? List those things you think that makes it positive/negative for you, Is it something you really want to let someone know?</li>
<li>Did I make more connections this year, Connection really matters, you never know when you’ll need someone, no one is asking you to go around making friends and hanging out, you’ll land in deep trouble you know nothing about.</li>
<li>What did I spend most of my time on this year, was it really necessary, do they contribute to my future? If no, how do I significantly reduce(reduce, not stop, it might be impossible or depressing to stop at once)?</li>
<li>If I have a magic wand, what will I ask for and why did I choose that, What can I do to get that without a magic wand?</li>
<li>Finally, after this 15 keys, am I positive about this coming year or should I work on my self before setting a new resolution</li>
</ol>
