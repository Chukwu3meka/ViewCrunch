Importance of sleep from a personal view
<p>
  I used to and still have a very poor sleeping habits, never getting the right amount of sleep. Its either I over slept or am looking
  sleep deprived and then find my self complaining about not having enough sleep. There are other troubles I noticed with my horrendous
  sleep habit and a major solution to this will be to set a fixed time to sleep and get up; you should follow this pattern whether you
  fell like sleeping or not, just lie on the bed, eyes closed. Mean while, here are some benefits of getting right amount of sleep.

  If you have trouble sleeping or still feel sleepy when you�re sure you�re awake and sure you�ve had enough sleep; Consider adjusting
  your sleep routine, other things you can do to improve your sleep includes:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Getting up early, at least 7hrs of sleep each night. I still struggle with 7 and am looking at making it 8.</li>
  <li>Avoid siesta or nap after 3pm.</li>
  <li>Avoid night light(phone, TV, game, laptop, and other gadgets) for at least 2hrs before sleep.</li>
  <li>
    When I started, I could lie on the bed, eyes closed for over 3hrs before falling asleep, just keep your eyes closed and focus on your
    breathing or better still, pray your Rosary.
  </li>
  <li>You build muscles when you sleep and worn out tissues are fixed while you�re asleep.</li>
  <li>You do less by sleeping less, don�t be deceived with grinding. Get enough sleep for your health.</li>
  <li>Avoid excessive caffeine and consumption of alcohol</li>
</ol>

  Jeff Bezos makes 8hrs sleep a priority, Elon Musk has appr. 6hrs while Bill Gates, 7hrs. You get the key persistence is key, Success
  and happiness is not tied to a specific time. Don�t get to sleep 12hrs on weekend and 6hr on weekdays
