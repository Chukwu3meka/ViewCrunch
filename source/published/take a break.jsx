      This might not be a mind in blowing post, where you learn new tricks and hacks, but if you're one of those people out there with
      depression, limited satisfaction, continuous contemplation, goals without reach and many more. I'd like you to know this, What am
      about to tell you might not be cure, but it will go a long way to help you prevent some unnecessary problems you create for your
      self.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Your mind will present you with the greatest trouble imaginable, take a breather here; even if you choose to lead a care free
          life
        </li>
        <li>
          The same way you look at people and wish to be like them, is the same way they look at you and wish to be like you. You will
          only understand this if they open up and tell you the challenges they are going through; No one is free from problem, even if
          some are more troublesome

          I never saw myself as some one that could complete any task and this belief dealt with my esteem and added to my newly found
          "lovely and introvertish nature" that used to be a burden

          Being a computer science grad was never part of my wish, but by the grace of God, I have a CS degree. Not a single pride to
          mention that just for the fact that a project I completed recently @ <a href="https://www.soccermass.com">SoccerMASS</a> I say
          this jokingly but skip to the point if you're not familiar with ICT terms I play game a lot, but I had this dream of developing
          <a href="https://www.soccermass.com">SoccerMASS: a soccer management game</a> in my sophomore, but at that time I was
          interested in networking, security and programming, so I was foolishly doing more that five things at the same time, while
          neglecting my primary goal as a student and with no success in time management I messed a lot of things , to cut the long story
          short, I streamlined my focus to academics gave little time to web development which is a good starting point for programming.
          I started with pure HTML and PHP and latter moved to react and Next.Js. So I ended up doing the same thing three different
          times, and right now am working on mobile development. A few friends were happy with my progress, but I didn't see it that way,
          all I could see was that I completed a goal I set since 2015: What I failed to realize was:
          <ul>
            <li>In every goal setting each step is a win and you keep winning until the last step</li>
            <li>
              I made money(in my final year project, by helping others with their projects), since I already had experience in web
              development
            </li>
            <li>I learnt so many new tools, because with each difficulty, a new learning.</li>
          </ul>
          All I'll say here is focus on your wins, and you might not meet your goal but you'll achieve something more.
        </li>
        <li>
          find a polite strategy to ignore/snub(whatever you call it). Some people are not helpful at all. they've not found any reason
          to be alive and so seek a mate, and when you refuse to cling to their ideas, you become enemies
        </li>
        <li>
          There will always be something to worry about, but the difference between a winner and a loser is that a winner knows there's a
          problem and he also knows worry won't solve it.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        So continue to strive, continue to win and one simple thing to do daily is when you're about to sleep, count your wins for the
        day and always have something to be grateful for ***You might not have enough, but you have your family, well wishers, health and
        me.
