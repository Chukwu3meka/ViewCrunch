  I started using nextjs in may 2020, and i fell deeply in love with it for many reasons i'll publish a view for, but during my date with
  my newly found love "Next Js". I was faced with some problems or rather questions concerning Nextjs; among which was the use of custom
  server in nexts. at the time my only help was the nextjs doc as i didn't find much articles online that has to do with nextjs, and to
  add salt to injury all tutorials i was watching at that time used custom server commonly (express js) and next js versions less than
  9.0, to confuse me more i followed this tradition of custom server but whenever i run my code "next start" or "next dev". I get this
  wierd warning:

  I did more research only to discover that the common reason why developers use custom server was for dynamic routing. You might be
  asking why i don't want a custom server and my reason for seeing this as a problem and then i'll reply.

    I built a Web Application @ soccermass.com using react and at that time i already developed an API for SoccerMASS web, which i also
    plan to use when i develop the Mobile Application. After learning next js, i converted this react application to a nextjs app; So i
    found this cumbersome to start afresh working on a new server.
  </li>
  <li>
    I just didn't want to have express and other server side libaries installed in my nextjs enviroment, as i need to enjoy all important
    performance optimization that comes with Next.js
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It was too much of a stress managing separate servers(One for mobile and the other for web), that does the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end i discovered that all i needed to do was make the same API calls i used in react, and nextjs added fun to it by making
      it much more easier to get data using the getServerSideProps or getStaticProps
    </p>
    <pre>
		//getServerSideProps
	
		export const fetcher = (url, data) => {
			return fetch(url, {
			method: "POST",
			headers: new Headers({ "Content-Type": "application/json" }),
			body: data,
			credentials: "same-origin",
			}).then((res) => res.json());
		};
		
		const Profile = ({data}) => `getServerSideProps example JSON.stringify(data)`
		
		export default Profile;
	
		export const getServerSideProps = async ({
			const data = await fetcher("/api/getNames", JSON.stringify({format: "only names"})
			
			return {
				props: { data }
			};
		};

  <li>Disable file-system routing</li>

  If you research further, you'll see newer versions of nextjs already have all the benefits for custom server. So i conclude by saying
  that if you are using custom server in nextjs just for dynamic routing, nextjs 9.4 has redeemed by adding getStaticProps and this
  version also comes with css and sass support out of the box with no extra configuration, with SASS.
</p>

<pre>

	//you just install the SASS package **run** 
	
	npm i sass
	

	//'i' short for install
	//'sass' SASS package to be insalled
