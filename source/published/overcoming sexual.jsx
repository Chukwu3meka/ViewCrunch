      <p>
        You just saw a very handsome/beautiful person and you kept on starring, What else are you looking for on/in the person's body;
        Point of correction, your prolonged look is no longer admiration but lust, the same thing that happens when you move past a cute
        person and tilt your neck, to have a clear view. Avoid it, it will doo you no good looking; the more you look the less you see,
        the less you see the more your mind wonders, and when this goes on for a long period, next place you'll see your self is
        indulging in the same sin with or without the same person and most times yourself.

        You are not a man or woman because of your freedom to do whatever you like, but your ability to control your emotions. Its hard,
        and its not always about you, its against principalities and powers, from my perspective, if you engage in any form of sexual
        immorality and don't feel awkward later on, its either you need medical attention or your possesed, believe me. It might be your
        perversion that leads you to this sin, but Here are some easy to difficult things you can do to help yourself in the long run:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Avoid Contact:
          <p>
            Am one of those people that become agitated when you hug, if there's any way for me to skip it without embarrassing the
            person, that I always do; such as offering a hand shake before the person approaches and if you're really serious about it,
            then i have nothing to do. Also if you really want to avoid contact, do so with some careless and sensitive kind of play all
            times; bottom line avoiding contact is your first step to overcome sexual sin.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Love not 'Lust yourself' :
          <p>
            Avoid touching or looking at these sensitive parts of your body that makes you satisfy your masculine/feminine emotions, not
            even for a moment, except when you bath, and even at that, bath with a bit loss of concentration. When you sleep, avoid loose
            clothing, to reduce movement of these parts of your body.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Pornography :
          <p>
            If you do all this and still watch or listen to any adult scene in the movie, picture, music, adverts, Internet popup or even
            pornography itself, you're bound to fall. Pornography is everywhere and hard to avoid(very hard) even sports analyst, weather
            forecaster, agents, actor/actress, musicians try to entice or rather seduce their viewers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Self Control :
          <p>
            It all boils down to self control and determination. You're not a man by sleeping with every girl that comes your way. It's
            your ability to control yourself that makes you a man. Some have better control than others, there are ways to improve your
            self control in the seventh step.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid sleeping in :
          <p>
            Late nights are not good at all if you're just starting this journey of overcoming sexual sin. Naturally we are weak at
            night(body and soul). Your inclination to sin is higher at night, you can attest to this. Try to give yourself a fixed time
            of sleeping and waking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Control your taught :
          <p>
            This step is very important to overcome sexual sin, the devil has only one door to get us and its our 'will'. You need to
            protect your mind at all times, whether you believe in the devil or not, it will feed you with all kinds of evil taught. An
            idle mind is the devil's workshop; this doesn't mean that when you're busy, you're safe. 'Whatever the mind of man can
            conceive it can achieve': Napoleon Hill. At all cost avoid staying alone, don't go hard on yourself if you're of melancholic
            nature. This taught build up most when you're alone, most especially with an opposite sex.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Prayer :
          <p>
            Its going to be hard at first, but if you do all this accompanied with prayer, it will be easier. Make it your goal to pray
            in the morning and not to sin and then watch yourself through out the day. We've been made weak by sin, and mortification is
            an act which seeks to undo or destroy our sinful nature. Try any of the following, but watch yourself in the process, so you
            don't overdo it. You're not here to kill yourself but your sinful nature:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unostentatious fasting and altruistic abstinence.</li> <li>Pious Kneeling and Praying.</li>
            <li>Resolution to stop a less grievous sin.</li> <li>Reading the Bible/Quran.</li>
            <li>Cold bathing or sleeping on the floor (be careful here).</li> <li>Sacrificial giving of alms.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        ### Bonus tip: If you're a Christian or you belief permits you, when this sexual urge comes up, take any picture of Christ
        crucifixion and while you stare, meditate on his passions/agony. You can also save this picture on your phone and use it any
        time.
