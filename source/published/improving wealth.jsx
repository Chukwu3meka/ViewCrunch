        What makes a person richer, is it his assets or money in the bank? Whatever your definition, its upto you, but we'll look at that
        on two scales, with the other favored by so many and that why it's common to hear make money while you sleep.

          Money in the bank: <br />
          If the money in your account, be it savings or current is a debt you owe the bank, your friend or papa's money, company's money
          to book a flight or hotel, emergency funds or whatever, we are all guilty of wasting money or not making the best use of it, if
          we forget to pay our debts, leave money in allow interest accounts and the worst will be to have debts because it will
          accumulate and you'll have to pay so much interest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assets: <br />
          We are all advised not to buy what we do not need which is true, but at times, we waste money on things we need, for instance
          you could buy a house $3000, and hope to sell if for $10,000 in seven years, this makes sense to me only if you put the house
          on lease till you're ready to sell, having a gold(phone, watch, etc.) will make your friends and social media revere you, but i
          promise, the reverence wont last long if you only use that year-in year-out, but i won't because there are better
          phones/watches out there than those coated with gold. Only if you plan on extracting the gold and selling later on, which would
          never happen; bottom line don't let any asset sit idle.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Finally remember that all fingers are not equal, some have more, others less; There are those who don't have at all, so instead
        of cleaning your ass with a dollar consider a more charitable cause.
