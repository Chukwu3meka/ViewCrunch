Why confess your sins to man; Only God can forgive

My first question would be, what was Christ referring to when he said “Whatever you bind on earth is bound in heaven”? If your answer is “evil spirit” you’re indirectly calling God a liar, since you mean we have evil spirits in heaven to bind; You’re also aware that nothing unclean can come in heaven.

Christ shouldn't have come to earth(Jn 3:16) in the first place, since we could have easily asked for forgiveness in the privacy of our room. In John 20: 21 - 23 Jesus said to them again, ‘Peace be with you. As the father sent me, so I send you.’ Then he breathed on them and said “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive people’s sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.”. The apostle have passed this power to forgive sins down to Priest through the Bishop ever since the institution of the church in Mt 16: 18-19 “And so I tell you, Peter: You are a rock, and on this rock foundation I will build my church, and not even death will ever be able to overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, what you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven, and what you bind”.

The priest acting in the person of Christ after hearing your sins, says the prayer of absolution like so “God, the father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the Holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins; through the ministry of the church, may God grant you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the Holy Spirit”. Can you loose or bind a rope without seeing it, so can the priest not bind or loose your sins without hearing them first.

<b>Note that we confess our sins to God through a priest, appointed by our LORD and Saviour as an Alter Christus(In the person of Christ)</b> as said in James 5:16 “So then, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you will be healed. The prayer of a good person has a powerful effect”. Your confession is complete only when you have the intention of returning to God like the prodigal son and have acknowledged your sins with true sorrow before approaching his representative, the priest to confess your sins and then make conscious effort to amend your life and then your penance. Where possible, do what is possible to repair harm of offence such as returning stolen goods, paying compensation for damage done, seeking forgiveness from the person offended in cases like slander and calumny, etc. Last days are given to us in abundance.

Some common points to note in confession

<ul>
<li>Another scriptural reading to support confession would be Mathew 18:18 "And so I tell al of you - What you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven and what you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven"
</li>
<li>You have to know that by confession, you learn humility which is conveniently avoided when one confesses only through private prayer. By going up to the priest, you showed removed pride
</li>
<li>You receive sacramental graces when you confess your sins, through the prayer of absolution the priest says</li>
<li>You are assured your sins are forgiven, because of your faith in Luke 5:20 "When Jesus saw how much faith they had, he said to the man, 'Your sins are forgiven, my friend'"</li>
<li>If you are ashamed of going to confession, that shows pride. Remember in the old testament the Jews move around with sack cloth, ashes on their body and at times are separated from others in the camp.</li>
<li>The seal of confession prohibits a confessor from betraying a penitent in any way for any reason. it forbids a priest from disclosing the identity of the penitent and the sin or sins that he or she has confesses</li>
<li>Before confession, you've made a solemn promise not to sin again despite of your human weakness, after a thorough and conscious reflection, you are fully aware of your sins</li>
<li>Priest have been ordained to forgive sins irrespective of their moral state, A doctor having cancer is not restricted from attending to a patient, or will a patient say because you have cancer don't examine me.</li>
<li>For a priest to celebrate mass in a state of mortal sin would be sacrilegious, yet the sacrament would be valid. That is true for confession. Christ is the principal actor of the sacraments, so they are efficacious even when performed by an unworthy minister</li>
</ul>
