  Saturday, May 2001 you get a call from an old friend Dandy who has become so wealthy and famous, he tells you he'll come visiting with
  a whole lot of his friends and family to your place in a month time to celebrate his birthday. He then wires money to your account and
  you end up spending weeks discussing with your friends about Dandy, how he was poor, dull, dirty, timid all of sudden things turned
  around he became so rich,logical,confident and successfull. Saturday morning June 2001, a call from Dandy to remind you that he's on
  his way, and boom!!! Panic mode activated, you gather your kids to vacuum the whole house, empty your bin that has become a member
  staying with you for over a three weeks, you begin to tidy the bed then you discover a faulty connection, you call the electriccan to
  fix it, washing the toilet, you dicover the tap is faulty, you begin a new episode with the plumber making him hurry that he becomes
  nervous and redecorate your house with pipe, nailing and cement. When your guest arrive, he finds your house looking like a rabbit
  farm.

  Do you really need to go through all things
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Rush to Church/Mosque or Temple</li>
  <li>Exam rush that leaves you hospitalized</li>
  <li>Interview rush that make you look like a thug</li>
  <li>Deadline approching</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You do not have to wait for the D-day, you start now this very second to take action, When in school you don't wait for the exam
  timetable before you start reading, neither do you wait for your house to be flooded before you call the plumber. Finally you don't
  wait for your death before you visit the Doctor or remember God.
