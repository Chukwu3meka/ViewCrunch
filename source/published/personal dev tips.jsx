      Below are some tips that have worked for me and i still put into practice.
      <ul>
        <li>Wake early: There is no "BUT" for me here</li>
        <li>
          Pick a reachable goal for the day: be it to design one webpage, skip meal, work out, or even bath; Choose something that at the
          end of the day, you'll be proud to tell a stranger/friend 'I achieved this today'
        </li>
        <li>
          Select your time frame: If I spend 3 hours on a goal and end up not reaching it, its a win for me and then i move to something
          else. When next I come back to this task, it doesn't take up to 20 minutes to complete.
        </li>
        <li>Have someone to discuss your wins with, someone inspiring and motivating</li>
        <li>some days are brighter some tasks take much longer to complete; Don't go hard on yourself for not seeing it through</li>
        <li>
          It took me five years to complete a soccer manager game @ <a href="https://www.soccermass.com">SoccerMASS</a> and up to this
          point I'm proud to say that's my favorite project even though I'm currently working on a breaking upgrade. I started the
          project in LAMP, then MERN and now Next.Js and next will be a cross platform mobile version. Focus on the present count your
          improvement and overlook the time it's taking.
        </li>
        <li>Be open to changes, accept helpful feedbacks and constructive criticism; Only then will you be able to take corrections</li>
        <li>Try to connect with people, there's always someone willing to help</li>
        <li>
          Along the way, you might meet more discouragement than you anticipated but remember that Coca-Cola sold only 5 bottles in its
          first year, but have grown into a multi million company
        </li>
        <li>
          There's no discouragement compared to that coming from close ones, you might face that but sticking to your goal will do more
          good
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
