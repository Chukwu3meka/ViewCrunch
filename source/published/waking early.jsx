        Having spent major part of my life as a night owl and only having to wake on time for mass, early lectures or travel, with
        Saturdays as an off day, I sleep in, to get up about 11:30am.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided a month ago to read some books on 'mornings' and also listen to podcast, I learned that a lot of benefits are
        associated with getting up early ranging from health benefits. Fortunately, I started my early morning journey expecting a lot of
        things, which includes
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>I found that waking up without the noise of the day offered a mental boost and time to plan for the day.</li>
        <li>Waking before others gave a sense of superiority and helped to regulate my horrible sleeping habit.</li>
        <li>
          Before 12:00pm i would have achieved my primary goal for the day, which gave a sense of fulfillment and psychological strength.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm not in any way stating that late owls won't enjoy any of these benefits I've mentioned, but quoting the popular saying
          'only the dead have seen the end of war', and mind you I'm not dead anyway; I'll like to say that having lived as a night owl
          for a very large portion of my life coupled with irregular sleeping habits, I'll like you to know that my life has been much
          better now, thanks to a better decision making, problem solving skills and time to reflect on things.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you've been a night owl, it would be near impossible for you to wake early on a cold day, when your don't have a joyful
            reason(goal) to. I always set a goal before going to bed, that i look forward to accomplish when am awake, so when my alarm
            goes up, a already have my foot on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've set a goal for next month to wake at - -:- - am for the rest of the month. Start slowly and you don't need to look at
            anyone's routine, fix your own time there [4, 5, 6, 7, or even 8] whichever that works for you, and as you grow in the
            morning routine you can always adjust the time. I don't encourage anyone to lose sleep for any reason at all, you should get
            at least 7 hours of sleep every night. I'm working on a view that helps you stay awake when you get up early.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      You'll enjoy more benefits than yo can imagine, ranging from:
      <ul>
        <li>More productivity as a result of good sleep</li>
        <li>Reduced stress as waking early eliminates 'need for speed'</li>
        <li>Waking early pushes you to bed on time, giving you enough time to rest</li>
        <li>Trust me and try the morning routine for seven das in a row, I've been there, and i promise better transformation.</li>
      </ul>
    </>
