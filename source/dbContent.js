<!-- Three most important things in life -->
<p>
  When you hear someone talk about 'most important', it does'nt mean other criteria not in the list are not valueable or totally useless.
  For instance to able to study a particular course in the university, you need certain subjects with good grades up to a given score
  which is specified as 'minimum requirement'.
</p>
<p>
  When you're up for promotion, its based on your contributon to the team and how long you have served, but i tell you, if you don't take
  care of your health, you'll spend useful time in the hospital which you might end up fired even before promotion. Punctuality, social
  skill, vocabulary, commitment and so on; this little details don't really matter, but having a very bad rating in any of them, might be
  a roadblock to your promotion.
</p>
<h2>
  Now, back to business
</h2>
<p>
  The three most important things in life in no particular order are Rest, Moral and Career, and like i said you need other stuff to
  enjoy this three very well.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Career:
    <p>
      There is no job or school on earth without requirement be it 3 years in this or that. Your employer expects you to have learnt some
      things during those years. Learning being accumulated knowledge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Builds memory</li>
      <li>Improves learning speed</li>
      <li>Makes you more confident</li>
      <li>Keeps your brain healthy</li>
      <li>Prolongs lifespan</li>
      <li>Helps your finance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You get job(contract or fulltime) based on what you've learnt in the past. Nobody would hire a liability. Learning connects you
      with people, and this connections recommends you.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Moral
    <p>
      I don't know how atheist do it, but if you're someone like me who without prayer ends up doing something immoral, despite the
      decision not to do that. Mind you our body is weak. Muslim, Christian or any other religion lets people know the importance of
      prayer in soceity because it's a period where you disconnect from the world and connect with the divine, and that is why somewhere,
      somewhere said, 'Educating a child without religion is raising educated criminals'. I'm not saying Atheist are evil, as a matter of
      fact, you find Atheist who do good compared to Theist. Not as if those who pray don't fall but they are strenghtened spiritually to
      do more good.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Rest
    <p>
      Game, Excercise, Sleep etc is very important; Your muscles don't build when you excercise, its when you sleep, you're not sure
      about the line you just read, but there're so many benefits of sleep:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improves Memory</li>
      <li>Prevents Cancer</li>
      <li>Increses your reasoning</li>
      <li>Healtheir Heart</li>
      <li>Spur Creativity</li>
      <li>Makes you more attentive</li>
      <li>Better Productivity</li>
      <li>Prevents depression</li>
      <li>Stronger immune system</li>
      <li>Prvents mistake</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Aside sleep i don't expect you to work through out the day, take some time of gaming, chatting, movie and other fun things to gain
      more sleep
    </p>
  </li>

  `As we wonder through life most time aimlessly,though the wrong direction we end up stuck at one sport or the other.We call this getting
stuck addiction and i had to live with mine for 8 years. Addiction can come in many forms be it
fear,Alcohol,Masturbation,drugs,game,soccer etc 1.Fear; when i was younger,i was a complete definition of introvert multiplied by
melancholy. i didn't see it as a problem as i enjoyed being alone even till this point.I found out one day when i went to read in church
that i had a trembling legs like someone suffering from cold while being electorcuted,that was containable,but the notable fact was that
when i took the mic to read i discovered my voice had left and then i was speaking like an 89 years old lady laden with stroke every
other illness was cracking as if there was a severve Network problem. 1. I had to start metting people and trying to speak while
maintaining eye contact 2.

  `<!-- Improving wealth on two major scales -->
<desc>
  What makes a person richer, is it his assets or money in the bank? Whatever your definition, its upto you, but we'll look at that on
  two scales, with the other favoured by so many and that why it's common to hear make money while you sleep.

  What makes a person richer, is it his assets or money in the bank? Whatever your definition, its upto you, but we'll look at that on
  two scales, with the other favoured by so many and that why it's common to hear make money while you sleep.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Money in the bank: <br />
    If the money in your account, be it savings or current is a debt you owe the bank, your friend or papa's money, company's money to
    book a flight or hotel, emergency funds or whatever, we are all guilty of wasting money or not making the best use of it, if we
    forget to pay our debts, leave money in alow interest accounts and the worst will be to have debts because it will accumulate and
    you'll have to pay so much interest.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assets: <br />
    We are all advised not to buy what we do not need which is true, but at times, we waste money on things we need, for instance you
    could buy a house $3000, and hope to sell if for $10,000 in seven years, this makes sense to me only if you put the house on lease
    till you're ready to sell, having a gold(phone, watch, etc.) will make your friends and social media revere you, but i promise, the
    reverence wont last long if you only use that year-in year-out, but i won't because there are better phones/watches out there than
    those coated with gold. Only if you plan on extracting the gold and selling later on, which would never happen; bottom line don't let
    any asset sit idle.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Finally remember that all fingers are not equal, some have more, others less; There are those who don't have at all, so instead of
  cleaning your ass with a dollar consider a more charitable cause.
